As a result, the temperature distribution won't match the original image, and the heat-based swells won’t either.

As a result, the temperature distribution won't match the original image, and the heat-based swells won’t either.

If we simply make the entire pattern uniformly gray or black, the wider lines tend to overheat while the thinner ones don’t heat up enough due to the heat conduction. As a result, the temperature distribution won't match the original image, and the heat-based swells won’t either. To address this, we perform “optimization” to adjust the shading in different areas so that the resulting temperature distribution, after heat conduction, matches the original image as closely as possible. The simulation is based on the custom parameters you set [here](#scrollTo=jNyYGd1sY4Z_)."
